A kind of mini social media webpage. Design is up to you. You have the option to show creativity and design sense. For example: you can chose facebook, twitter as a reference.

It can have additional features like -
1. User can upload video, and then watch it in the page. There can be a list of all videos.
2. User can make post and new post can be shown along with other posts as a list.
3. User can capture live photo or video with audio, using the webcam, rather than upload from file system. That should also be visible as a list.
4. The location of the user can be added with their posts or videos. Show the location of user beside their name.
5. The datetime of post also should be added beside their name.
6. Anyone can react on the posts.

Instructions:
1. You should implement as many features as you can; preferably all, if possible.
2. Remember, 100% completed 2/3 features is better than incompleted 5/6 features.
2. Only use HTML, CSS, JS. NOTHING ELSE.
3. If you need storage, just use the file system for now. No database needed.
